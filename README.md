# Things implemented in this App

Please keep in mind that this is a very basic Flutter App which I built while I just started exploring Flutter. But I have optimized the code and improved the UI.
This App contains the implementation of the followings:
  - Custom Fonts as Icons
  - Android's default Navigation GestureBar as an overlay
  - Custom Firebase Text by Text Search
  - Customizing Status Bar & Navigation Tab
  - Custom Icon & Splash Screen
  - Various Material Components

# How to get this Repo and run it on your System

I kept the code as original as possible with prober Commented Guides for anyone to understand and implement. Still you need to follow these steps.
  - First get Flutter and all necessary SDK/Plugins installed. Full guide here [Flutter: Get Started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
  - Now create a new Flutter App, named as **'badassicons'** with AndroidX Compatibility.
  (You can also work without AndroidX for this simple app, but for adding other advanced features in your app, its recommended to use AndroidX).
  
    ```
    flutter create --androidx badassicons
    ```
  - Now download this [Repo](https://codeload.github.com/AkashDivya/BadassIcons-Flutter-Custom-Font-Icons/zip/master)
  - Extract the Repo into your newly created **badassicons** and replace the required files.
  - Now you can Finally run VS-Code or Android Studio whichever you prefer and get the flutter packages and just run the App.

# About Me

I'm a veteran Designer/Animator with **10+ years** of experience. I always hated the excuses Developers gave me when they fail to implement my Design. One day, when I found about Flutter I said no more & started learning it.
